# Sudoku Solver
This is a sudoku solver which uses the backtracking algorithm. It can be run in two ways - on the terminal window or using the GUI.

# Instructions
To try it out yourself run the Sudoku_GUI.py file. You are given a sudoku. Use your mouse to select a box and add a number at a time. Press the enter key to submit a number and the del key to delete it. To solve the remaining puzzle (after atleast one incorrect attempt), just press the Space-bar and watch the algorithm do its magic!

To simply run it on your command prompt, open the sudokuSolver.py file, modify the board, and run it.
